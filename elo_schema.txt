        will need bot to load in tables
        will need function for ladder reset
    Admin: certain functions on discord will need an admin password to avoid player interference with data
    DM support: bot will need to send DMs to players 

QUESTIONS
    do we let people queue for 1s and 3s at the same time, or should queueing for one take you out of the other?
    do we want to track MMR for pickups / random teams, or only established teams?
