## Introduction

The Ravens Nest is a combination queueing and MMR system for deployment on a discord server. It aims to replace
some of the more cumbersome elements of Armored Core VIs multiplayer experience and to foster a competetive 
ranked environment. The bot keeps track of a playerbase and teambase, facilitates matches through a reimplementation
of the queue system present in ACVI with improvements (such as the ability to queue with a party), and performance
tracking through a database of ELO rankings.
